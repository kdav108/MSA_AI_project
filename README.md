Project name: Detecting Parkinnson's Disease

Project idea: Having a passion for Software Engineering in the medical field, this project focuses on using Machine Learning to train a model to classify a healthy person from a person with Parkinson's Disease using several voice measurements of the person.

Algorithm used: Since the problem/idea is about predicting from 2 possible outcomes (classification) and the data set is quite small (only 195 rows), I decided to use Gradient boosting to build my model. 

Data Source: The data was downlaoded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/parkinsons. There are 195 rows and 23 columns in the raw data set. The data is also slightly biased in that 23 of the 31 participating people tested for their vocal measurements had Parkinnson's Disease. There was the option of removing some of the data sets relating to people with parkinson's Disease, to lessen this biasedness, however, this would reduce the already small data set, so this option was not exercised. 

How to test the model?: 


References: The background to understand the relation between vocal measurements and Parkinson's disease was gained from the following research paper: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5549905/
